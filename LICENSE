                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            PreamBLE

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use this
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms
that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get
the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and
developers' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting
users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such
abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is
precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this
version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such
problems arise and persist in a few jurisdictions, we consider that to
be a demonstration that those jurisdictions are hostile to users' freedom
and that the GNU GPL version 3 should not be used there.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy. The resulting /new/ work is called a "modified version" of
the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for copyright
infringement, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private
copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without
modification), making available to the public, and in some countries
other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a
computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to
the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature
that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user
that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that
warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under
this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface
presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent
item in the list would qualify as an "Appropriate Legal Notice".

1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a
work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A "Major
Component", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel,
window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any)
on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the
work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System
Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs
which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are
not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface
definition files associated with source files, and the source code for
shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication
or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same
work.

2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the sole purpose
of enabling you to "run" a covered work, but only if you comply with
this License in all respects. Propagating a covered work is permitted
only if you meet the conditions of this License. Public display of a
covered work does not require a license.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under Article 11
of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar
laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent that such
circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with
respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit
operation or modification of the work to be operated or modified by you
exclusively or to enforce a fee for exercising or performing the right to
do so.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms
of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

  a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
  it, and giving a relevant date.

  b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
  under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This
  requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all
  notices".

  c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
  anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore
  apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the
  whole, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This
  License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it
  does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

  d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
  "Appropriate Legal Notices"; however, if the Program has interactive
  interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work
  need not make them do so.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also meet these conditions:

  a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
  (including a physical distribution medium), or in a medium commonly
  used for software interchange, for no more than a reasonable charge for
  the cost of physically performing this conveying, or
  (2) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
  to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of
  physically performing this distribution of source, a complete
  Corresponding Source for the work to be conveyed, which is to be
  distributed under the terms of section 1.
  (3) Convey the individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
  computer-readable Corresponding Source, distributed under the terms of
  section 1, on a durable physical storage medium customarily used for
  software interchange.
  (4) Convey the object code by offering access to copy the
  Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, or
  (5) Convey the object code by providing access to copy the
  Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. This is
  permitted only if you make available the Corresponding Source for as
  long as you offer that access.

  b) The Corresponding Source for a work in object code form must be
  included in an archive format customarily used for software interchange.

  c) You must provide "Appropriate Legal Notices" for each user facing
  interactive interface.

  A covered work in object code form needs not include any portions of
its Corresponding Source that are already present in the source form
of the work.

7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as if they were included in this License, to the extent that
they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply
only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under
those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this
License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal
in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional
permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you
have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

  a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
  terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

  b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
  author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
  Notices displayed by works containing it; or

  c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
  requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
  reasonable ways as differing from the original version; or

  d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
  authors of the material; or

  e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
  trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

  f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material
  by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with
  contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any
  liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those
  licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you
received it, or any covered work you convey, contains such further
restrictions, you must remove them before conveying it. You may not
propagate or modify a covered work if you are an agent of such a
licensor or cannot obtain permission to remove them.

  If a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of
the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
you, then the only way you could convey it is to arrange for revocation
of that patent license or to procure an arrangement that is more favorable
to royalty-free redistribution.

  If you are in a jurisdiction that recognizes copyright assignment in
certain works, such as "work made for hire", you must still remain
accountable under this License, even if you are an agent of such a
licensor.

8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the first
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by any reasonable means prior
to 30 days after you cease the violation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
permanently if the copyright holder grants you express permission to do
so.

  This section does not affect the patents licenses of parties who have
received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights
terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not have permission to
run or propagate the access you received to those materials.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing
grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These
actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of
this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  A "transactional arrangement" is an express arrangement that
conditions the grant of a patent license or copyright license on the
conveyance of the Program or a work based on the Program. If you engage
in a transactional arrangement, you may not obtain payment for conveying
a protected work under this License if the payment is associated with
the transactional arrangement unless you also make available the
protected work for conveying without charge by any of your agents or
licensees.

  "Further restrictions" are non-permissive additional terms imposed
either to prevent or penalize exercise of rights granted under this
License or to require or coerce the recipient to waive or forswear
exercise of rights granted under this License. You may not impose any
further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed
under this License.

11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. A work
is "contributed" by the copyright holder if it is made available under
this License.

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned
or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter
acquired, that would be infringed by some manner of making, using, or
selling, of the Program.

  You grant every contributor a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license, under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make,
use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate
the contents of the Program.

  In the above three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  Every "transactional arrangement" by which you convey a covered work
provides an effective patent license from the contributors whose
essential patent claims are embodied in the covered work, in accordance
with the patent license of such contributors.

  A "contributor" is an entity who licenses or sublicenses a covered
work under this License.

  A patent license that is "contingent" on payment of royalty or
other consideration is not an essential patent license. An essential
patent license may be made contingent on (1) an additional express
commitment to grant a patent license to all interested parties for free,
and (2) an additional express commitment to grant an irrevocable license
to all interested parties for free, and (3) an additional express
commitment to grant an irrevocable license to all interested parties for
free, and (4) an additional express commitment to grant an irrevocable
license to all interested parties for free, for the benefit of those
who have received copies of the Program.

  If you convey a covered work, you agree to waive any obligation to
grant a patent license for your essential patent claims under the first
paragraph of section 11.

  This section is intended to protect you from claims of patent
infringement when you use the Program.

12. No Free Lunch.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit you to distribute
copies of the Program for a fee, unless such distribution includes a
license to the Program, and to all portions of the Program that you
distribute, in such a way that the licensee also receives free use of
the Program.

13. Limitations on Warranty and Liability.

  The GNU General Public License does not make any promises or
representations with respect to the merchantability, fitness for a
particular purpose, or non-infringement of the Program. The GNU General
Public License is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind,
either express or implied.

14. Trademarks.

  The names of the Free Software Foundation, its logos, or any other
marks that identify the Free Software Foundation or its affiliates may
not be used as trademarks, except with the prior written permission
of the Free Software Foundation.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE
OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSS
ES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO
OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software that everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program. If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Web-MinecraftLogAnalyzer Copyright (C) 2025 LanRhyme
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.

to your projects, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
