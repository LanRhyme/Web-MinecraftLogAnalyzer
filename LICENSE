                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                    Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control.

  The license grants you the authority to propagate a covered work only
if you comply with its terms.  You may propagate the covered work in
unmodified form, but also in modified form under the terms of this
License.  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you must provide
the recipient with a copy of this License.  You may not impose any
further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed
under this License.  For example, you may not impose a license fee,
royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this
License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim
or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is
infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing
the Program or any portion of it.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
"measure" under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

  a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
  it, and giving a relevant date.

  b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
  released under this License and any conditions added under section
  7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
  "keep intact all notices".

  c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
  License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
  License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
  additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
  regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
  permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
  invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

  d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
  Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
  interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
  work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

  a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
  (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
  Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
  customarily used for software interchange.

  b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
  (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
  written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
  long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
  model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
  copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
  product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
  medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
  more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
  conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
  Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

  c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
  written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
  alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
  only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
  with subsection 6b.

  d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
  place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
  Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
  further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
  Corresponding Source with the object code.  If the place to
  copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
  may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
  that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
  clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
  Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
  Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
  available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

  e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
  you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
  Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
  charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
  from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
  included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
  tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
  family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
  incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a
  consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of
  coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user,
  "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of
  product, regardless of the status of the user or of the way in which
  the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use,
  the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of whether
  the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer
  uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of
  the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
  procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
  install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User
  Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The
  information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of
  the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with
  solely because modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
  specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
  part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
  User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
  fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
  Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
  by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not
  apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to
  install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the
  work has, aside from distribution, another purpose which does not
  require installation).

  If you convey an object code work with or without changes, you must
  afford recipients the ability to copy the Corresponding Source from
  the same place and for the same price as they would receive the
  object code.  If you convey this work under subsection 6d, the
  Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you
  or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, but
  you must ensure that the Corresponding Source is available for as
  long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

  For the User Product (excluding any software that is not part of the
  User Product), and if a patent license is needed for the User
  Product (such as for using some component of the User Product), the
  following terms apply:

  a) You must provide the Installation Information, but you may not
  impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights
  granted under this License, including but not limited to the rights
  to use, modify, sell, offer for sale, import, export, have made,
  and have sold the User Product, and to permit persons to whom the
  User Product is furnished to do so, except as otherwise provided in
  paragraph 6e.

  b) You must ensure that the Installation Information is available
  under terms that give recipients all the rights that the
  Corresponding Source's license grants them.  This includes the
  right to make, have made, import, export, have imported, sold,
  offer for sale, have sold, and license to third parties the User
  Product, and to permit persons to whom the User Product is
  furnished to do so, subject to the terms of the Corresponding
  Source's license.

  If it is not possible to comply with subsection 6a or 6b due to
  statutory requirements, you must indicate in a prominent place in
  each copy of the object code, or in the documentation accompanying
  the object code, that the User Product in question is not
  compliant, and explain the reasons for non-compliance.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
  License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
  Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program
  shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to
  the extent that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional
  permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be
  used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program
  remains governed by this License without regard to the additional
  permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
  remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part
  of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
  removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
  additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
  for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
  add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright
  holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with
  terms:

  a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
  terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

  b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
  author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
  Notices displayed by works containing it; or

  c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
  requiring that modified versions of the material be marked in
  reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

  d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
  authors of the material; or

  e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
  trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

  f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
  material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
  it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
  any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
  those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are void.  Only this
  License, or a future version of it on the terms of this License, may
  be used under this License.  But in order to be able to grant such
  additional permissions, you must obtain permission in writing from
  the copyright holders of the material so added.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
  must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
  additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
  where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in
  the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
  the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
  provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
  modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
  this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
  paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
  license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
  provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
  finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
  copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
  reasonable means prior to 60 days after cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
  reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
  violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
  received notice of violation of this License (excluding any notice
  that was part of a previous suspension) from that copyright holder,
  and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of
  the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
  the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
  under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
  permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses
  for the same material under this License.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
  run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
  occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
  to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
  nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
  modify any covered work.  These actions are prohibited by law if you
  do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating
  a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
  so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
  receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
  propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
  for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
  organization, or substantially all assets of an organization.  If
  through an entity transaction, a person acquires an organization
  or assets of an organization, and subsequently transfers the
  organization or assets to another person, the transfer does not
  affect the entity transaction's application of this License.  Only
  the individual transaction of the person or entity that bought the
  $$original$$ organization or assets is considered.  So, if a person
  acquires an organization and later transfers it to another person,
  the License applies to the transaction of the person who acquired
  the organization, not the transaction of the person who transferred
  it.

  To "grant" such a license is to agree to grant it to the recipient,
  if the recipient instantly and automatically receives the license
  when he receives the covered work.  The fact that you are also
  starting to perform the restricted acts at the same time you
  receive the covered work makes no difference; you must have the
  license before your performance.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
  License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
  work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
  owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired
  or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, however
  indirect, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but
  not including claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of
  further modification of the contributor version.  For purposes of
  this definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent
  licenses in a way that is not subject to the terms of this License.

  The extent of the patent license granted to you by a contributor
  is defined in the contributor's express grant of patent rights.  The
  contributor may grant you additional patent licenses (e.g., to use
  its patent claims in a different way), but you may not impose that
  choice.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license
  provided by a contributor, and the Corresponding Source of the work
  is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the
  terms of this License, through a publicly available network server
  or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause
  the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
  yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular
  work.

  If you convey a covered work which you did not author or sign, and
  you have reason to believe that your conveyance would result in a
  contributor's essential patent claims being infringed, you must
  inform the recipient of that fact.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
  arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
  covered work, and grant a patent license to some third party
  (other than your licensor) that is related to the conveyance of the
  covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically
  extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on
  it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
  the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
  conditioned on the non-exercise of one or $$or more$$ of the rights
  that are granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
  work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
  about to acquire or has acquired the necessary rights to such a
  patent license.

  Except as expressly provided in this License, no other patents
  licenses are implied by this License.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
  or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do
  not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
  convey a covered
